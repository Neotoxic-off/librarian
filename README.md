## üëì Features

- ‚úÖ Deep File Inspection ‚Äì Verifies file headers to prevent polyglot attacks
- ‚úÖ Entropy Analysis ‚Äì Flags files with unusually high entropy (possible encryption or packing)
- ‚úÖ Script Injection Detection ‚Äì Scans raw bytes for malicious patterns
- ‚úÖ Fast Recursive Scanning ‚Äì Uses <code>walkdir</code> for deep directory analysis
- ‚úÖ Multi-threaded Processing ‚Äì Parallel file scanning for maximum performance
- ‚úÖ CLI-based & Lightweight ‚Äì Built with <code>clap</code> and <code>log</code> for efficiency
